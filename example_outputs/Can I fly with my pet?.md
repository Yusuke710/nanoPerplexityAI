## Answer
Yes, you can fly with your pet in Australia. Here is some relevant information based on the context provided:

- Each airline in Australia has its own rules and restrictions regarding transporting pets, so it is essential to check with the specific airline you plan to fly with regarding their policies ([1](https://www.ferndalekennels.com/en/blog/can-you-take-your-dog-on-a-plane-in-australia/)).
  
- Generally, for domestic air travel in Australia with your dog or cat, you can check your pet in as excess baggage. However, if you are not traveling on the same flight as your pet, you may need to enlist a pet relocation agent for domestic travel ([2](https://petraveller.com.au/blog/domestic-air-travel-in-australia-with-your-pet)).

- Prior to traveling with your pet, it is important to take your furry friend to the vet for a check-up. Pets intending to travel by air need to be more than eight weeks old, appear to be in good health, and not show signs of undue aggression ([3](https://www.flightcentre.com.au/flights/planning-your-flight/travelling-with-pets)).

- Virgin Australia is planning to introduce pet-friendly flights within the next 12 months. Small cats and dogs will be allowed on certain domestic routes, confined to designated rows and carriers under the seat ([4](https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/travel-info/specific-travel/pets/)).

Remember, always contact the airline you plan to travel with for specific guidelines and requirements to ensure a smooth and safe journey for you and your pet.
